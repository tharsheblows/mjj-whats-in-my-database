# What's in my database?
This is a super simple WordPress plugin that lists every table and its columns in your database so you can check to see if there's anything unexpected in there. It *only* lists things, there's no ability to change anything in your database and, in fact, no user input at all. 

The page is in Tools and a user needs the 'list_users' capability to view it.

It might be an idea in the future to show all distinct meta_keys in wp_user_meta because sometimes people stash stuff in there, don't they?
